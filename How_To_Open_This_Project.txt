        🚀 BryTech server is running on port 3000
        🌐 Allowed URLs: [
        'http://localhost:5173',        
        'https://codewithbry.github.io',
        'https://codewithbry.github.io/BryTech/'
        ]
    
 Note:

    "localhost:5173" will open the Front-end's local server,
    While "localhost:3000" will open the Back-End's local server.

    The "localhost" will be the server that is running in your local machine
    While ":3000" or ":5173" is your PORT Number. This is like an adress of your computer that tells the internet where you open your project.
